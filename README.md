# Basic Bot
---

Basic bot is a Microsoft Bot framework bot written in C#. It was written as a proof of concept and not much more.
We have since discovered that the ability to connect to certain chat platforms severely limits the M$ bot framework. 

Our goal is to link to many chat services and we do not feel that Microsoft Bot Framework can really help us here.

We will probably be moving to node.js for future bot iterations. 
It's been fun. Sweet dreams for now Aila.

So long and thanks for all the fish.
